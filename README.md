This repository contains the code for the implementation and the verification of the topological sort algorithm.  
The implementation and specification is written using the Eiffel programming language.  
The verification is powered by the Autoproof tool included in EVE IDE for Eiffel language. For more information, see [here](http://se.inf.ethz.ch/research/eve/).

In order to run the code, you need to install EVE and import the project `topological_sort`.  
If you want to use Vagrant, a Vagrantfile with a Windows10 box is included. The code is synched to `/vagrant_data` folder.
